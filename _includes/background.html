      I am a Graduate Student at Arizona State University's <a class="underline-link" href="https://engineering.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering</a>, majoring in Computer Science.
      My research interests include Artificial Intelligence, Data Processing and Natural Language Processing.
      I aspire to become a full-time researcher and make people's life easier.

      As a software engineer, I enjoy developing softwares specifically back-end, combining my technical skills with my OCD to
      build a more efficient and optimized code. My aim is to always build applications which are scalable and reaching majority
      of the internet users thereby bringing a change.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably travelling, socializing with my fellow peers, 
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
